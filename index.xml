      <description>Hallo, Bonjour, Witam, Ciao, こんにちは, Hello and welcome.
You have reached the personal site of github user mikepro otherwise known as Michael. A web developer and user of emacs.
One of my main aims with this website is to introuduce emacs in a friendly and approcable way. Emacs has a fearsome reputation of having a step learning curve and being difficult to use. I can still remember the first time I opened up emacs (way back in 2001) and how overwhelemed I felt taking my first frustating steps, getting confused, getting anoyed with cryptic keyboard shortcuts and not understanding what I was doing.</description>
