        <p>Hallo, Bonjour, Witam, Ciao, „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ, Hello and welcome.</p>
<p>You have reached the personal site of github user <a href="https://github.com/mikepro">mikepro</a> otherwise known as Michael.  A web developer and user of emacs.</p>
<p>One of my main aims with this website is to introduce emacs in a friendly and approachable way. Emacs has a fearsome reputation of having a step learning curve and being difficult to use. I can still remember the first time I opened up emacs (way back in 2001) and how overwhelmed I felt taking my first frustrating steps, getting confused, getting annoyed with cryptic keyboard shortcuts and not understanding what I was doing.  This ultimately led to me quit emacs then and several times over the years. Now 21 years later its an absolute joy to use and I would not be without it.</p>
<p>Whilst I can certainly sympathise with the view that emacs is difficult to learn, knowing what I know now I don&rsquo;t believe that it has to be that way. Over the coming weeks and months I will write the articles that I wish I had, had access to when I started which I hope can make your journey discovering emacs much smother and more enjoyable.  Consider this site, me, as your mentor and guide for all things emacs.</p>
